### About MagiskHide WhiteList

After WhiteList is enabled, Magisk will be hidden from all apps by default and only previously apps have been granted root access from Magisk can continue to access Magisk.

Temporarily turn off MagiskHide WhiteList if you want to grant root access to new apps

MagiskHide WhiteList has significant performance and memory consumption issue and might break some modules that require app to read (overlay module, systemize app, ...). Only use WhiteList if necessary

### About Zygisk 💀

Zygisk is detectable and does not have hiding itself method like RiruHide. In additional, there are no hiding module that actually work, please don't enable Zygisk if unnecessary. [Read here to learn more about Zygisk...](https://huskydg.github.io/blog/zygisk-can-be-detected-very-easily)
